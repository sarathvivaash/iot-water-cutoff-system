# ðŸ§­ Methodology and System Design

## 1. Problem Identification

### 1.1 Background and Motivation
Water wastage in domestic environments results from manual monitoring of overhead tanks, causing overflow, water wastage, and motor burnout.  
In India, ~580.9 billion liters are wasted daily. This system automates monitoring and control using affordable IoT components.

### 1.2 Limitations of Existing Systems
- **Manual Timers:** Inaccurate and prone to human error.  
- **Float Switches:** Prone to mechanical wear and limited precision.  

### 1.3 Proposed Solution
A smart water cutoff and monitoring system using **ESP32** and **HC-SR04** for level detection.  
Communication via **LoRa / RF / Wi-Fi**, with real-time app analytics through **Flask + Flutter**.

**Key Features**
- Real-time level monitoring  
- Automatic motor cutoff  
- Dry-run protection  
- Analytics and alerts via app

## 2. System Design Overview

### Subsystems
1. **Sensor Unit:**  
   - Measures distance to water surface and converts it to level percentage.  
2. **Control Unit:**  
   - Based on ESP32; controls motor and implements dry-run detection logic.  
3. **Communication Unit:**  
   - LoRa modules for long-range wireless transmission.  
4. **User Interface:**  
   - Flutter app + Flask backend for analytics and control.

## 3. Hardware Implementation

### 3.1 Modules
#### Tank Module
- **Components:** ESP32, HC-SR04, LoRa, Boost Converter  
- Mounted on top of tank; sends data to main module.

#### Main Module
- **Components:** ESP32, LoRa, Relay  
- Controls motor based on received data.

### 3.2 Communication
- **RF/LoRa:** Low-power, long-range data transmission between modules.  
- **Wi-Fi/Bluetooth:** Alternate paths for local monitoring via app.

## 4. Key Functions
- **Water Level Monitoring:** Calculates tank fill percentage.  
- **Motor Control:** Automates ON/OFF actions.  
- **Dry Run Detection:** Stops motor during no intake.  
- **Data Logging:** Sends data to Flask server.  
- **User Interaction:** Via Flutter app.

## 5. Power Optimization
A **boost converter** is used to step up 3.7V Li-Po battery to 5V to stabilize ESP32 power supply and ensure reliable operation.

---

## 6. Future Enhancements
- Integration of water quality sensors.  
- Cloud dashboard for multiple tanks.  
- Solar-powered operation.  
- Voice-assistant integration.
